## Inline C, C++ or Fortran calls in R

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eddelbuettel/inline.png)](https://travis-ci.org/eddelbuettel/inline)

The inline package provides functionality to dynamically define R functions
(and corresponding S4 objects) from in-line C, C++ or Fortran code. It
supports both the `.C` and `.Call` calling conventions.

## History

The package was originally written while Oleg Sklyar was at
[EMBL-EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/).  It was later extended by Dirk
Eddelbuettel and Romain Francois extended for use by
[Rcpp](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html).
